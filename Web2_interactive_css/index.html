    <p>i used to work for this fellow.<span>under
        him. with him, you know.</span><br><br>
        he was a pretty nice guy.
    
        <span>
        he was white,
        but </font></span>i knew him from the church. <span>this
        won’t make sense if you're thinking of my church <i>home</i>. there were no white people where i worshipped. we worked together at the board of the worldwide church. (the only place where we integrate.)</span>
        <br><br>
        </span><p>he was from a powerful family. <span>he was also married to this sister. we were supposed to think he was therefore
        on our side or, you know, at least interesting.</span><br><br>
    
        <p>so anyway, <span>(it’s
        best not to dwell on white people’s miscalculations in public, even in
        invisible parentheticals) </span>he showed me the ropes at work. he was a
        mentor to me. <span>the
        only thing was, showing me the ropes often meant we had to be off somewhere
        alone together. the strangest things would happen in these moments, the
        first of which was when he reached inside my blouse to adjust my bra strap.
        he walked away, leaving me standing in the middle of the office floor,
        thinking about the two separate occasions in which a male had, without
        invitation, reached for my bra. the first time, the other kid and i were
        both around twelve years old. it was a little strange, but i was okay with
        it. he was a friend. this time, it felt creepy. on the one hand, there
        was the age difference. this guy was at least twenty years older than me.
        </span>on the other hand, he was a peer.
        <br><br>
        <span>i was, after all, eighteen. an adult now.</span> maybe it’s just like that when you’re
        an adult.
        <br><br>
        <span>but
        then he turned around and came towards me: “oh, don’t think anything of
        that,” he said. “i have a wife and kid, i would never . . .” i don’t remember
        whether he let it trail off like that or i just stopped listening.</span>
        <br><br>
        i never said anything to him about this. <span>but
        of course i thought something of it. standing there, head pounding. there
        was the attempt to pull my thoughts together. looking at the faces of people
        now walking by or moving around in nearby rooms. busy in their cubicles.
        busy in the copy room. there was the desire to keep this from happening
        again, but bigger than that was the desire for this to be nothing.</span>
        <br><br>
        this <span>
        is a series of things i told myself i had forgotten:
        there</span> was <span>
        the
        chance he really meant nothing by it, wasn’t there?
        and if i just made sure my bra strap didn’t show
        again, there would be
        nothing to question, right? i could tell him about my
        discomfort and he
        could get better (and keep explaining how he meant
        nothing by it) or get
        worse. or i could act like it was nothing and things
        could get better (because
        nothing had happened) or get worse. worst case
        scenario: i could say stop
        and he could show himself to be as evil as i feared
        him to be. best case
        scenario: i could say nothing and nothing (else) would
        happen. i was an
        optimist.</span>
